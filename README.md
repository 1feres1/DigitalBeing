## ML Capture

Record Video, Audio, and Sensors
Processes images, video, and text through machine learning models. 
Analyze data and gain insight in real time or on demand. 
See insights as tags, reports, and layers over media. 
Time Series of Insights are indexed for easy exploration.

Object, Scene, & Activity Detection

Identify thousands of objects (e.g. bike, telephone, building) and scenes (e.g. parking lot, beach, city). When analyzing video, you can also identify specific activities happening in the frame, such as "delivering a package" or "playing soccer".

Pose Matching, Gender & Age

Extract human movement and use it to reconstruct actions in 3D space. See animated hands, faces and bodies based on captured human movement. 

Face Detect, Facial recognition & Facial analysis

Fast and accurate search capability allows you to identify a person in a photo or video using your private repository of face images. You can analyze the attributes of faces in images and videos you provide to determine things like happiness, age range, eyes open, glasses, facial hair, etc. Measure how these things change over time, such as constructing a timeline of the emotions of an actor.

Gesture Recognition & Pathing

You can capture the path of people in the scene when using CV with video files. For example, you can use the movement of athletes during a game to identify plays for post-game analysis.

Transcript & Text Recognition 

Analyze text for topics, context, emotion, and errors. Detect and recognize text from images, such as handwriting, street names, captions, product names, and license plates.

Photogrammetry, Geopose, & XR Space

Create 3D Spaces from photos and video use photography and remote sensing to detect, measure and record complex 2-D and 3-D motion fields by feeding measurements and imagery analysis into computational models in an attempt to successively estimate, with increasing accuracy, the actual, 3-D of a scene and relative motions.
